        Today day was fine and nice weather by the way not so cold and not so hot the nice weather. And yeh i think i have read so much. 
        But i also don'w know what i do but i think i just learn something's new and that's fine. I am just trying and pushing my self.
        Little by little but this is enough for now i guess so. 
        Well the Mr.mnesma told me to do that the todolist thing's but i was not able to do that. May be that is hard for me or you can 
        say that i don't have the knoweldge about the class properly and also get so many confuse and the questions. 
        Sometimes i feel like there should be the person or the real mentor who can teach me in the real time. But yeh that is now possible. 
        For now.. So i have to to do and being stuck like this until i found some real mentor or until i become the master on it. 
        So today was kind of the nice day not so but yeh nice the i might have to say that insane youtube name his name is jamesshclz. 
        And yeh i am obviosuly listening his background rain musics. Which is so satisfying to me right now.

      i need to write a book of something's but instead writting a book for now i need to understand this Javascript script. Well there is the 
      thing's that i just get to knwo that js is not the weird just people have the lack of logics and the understanding problems which made
